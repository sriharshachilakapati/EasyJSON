# EasyJSON

An easy to use JSON library which has a common API which supports both standard Java and also GWT. No JSNI is being used. All the parsing will be done through Java code.

This exists because I wanted to learn how parsers work, and I've chosen JSON as it is a good format. This has no additional dependencies.
